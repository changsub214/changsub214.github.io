## Introduce

+ `Computer Security`

The generic name for the collection of tools designed to protect data and to thwart hackers.

+ `internet Security`

> lower case "i" refers to any interconnected collection of network

Consists of measures to deter, prevent, detect, and correct security violations that involve the transmission of information.

+ `NIST` (National Institute of tandards and Technology)

`NIST` defines the term computer security as 
> The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the `integrity`, `availability`, and `confidentiality` of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)

+ `Confidentiality`
    - `Data confidentiality`

    Assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals
    - `Privacy`

    Assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed

+ `Integrity`
    - `Data integrity`
    
    Assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner
    - `System integrity`
    
    Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system

+ `Availability`

Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users

## Five elements of `Data and services` from CIA TRIAL

`Confidentiality`, `Integrity`, `Availability`, `Authenticity`, `Accountability`

+ `Authenticity`

Verifying that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source 

+ `Accountability`

The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity

## Security attacks

A means of classifying security attacks, used both in `X.800` and `RFC4949`, is in terms of `passive attacks` and `active attacks`

`A passive attack` attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources

`An active attack` attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation

### Passive attacks

Are in the nature of eavesdropping on, or monitoring of, transmissions

Goal of the opponent is to obtain information that is being transmitted

Two types of passive attacks are `The release of message contents` and `Traffic analysis` 

### Active attacks

`Masquerade` 

Takes place when one entity pretends to be a different entity

Usually includes one of the other forms of active attack

`Replay`

Involves the passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retransmission to produce an unauthorized effect

`Modification of messages`

Some portion of a legitimate message is altered, or messages are delayed or reordered to produce an unauthorized effect

`Denial of service`

Prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of communications facilities

## Security services

### X.800

A service provieded by a protocol layer of communicating open systems and that ensures adequate security of the systems or of data transfers

#### `Authentication`

+ Peer entity authentication

Used in association with a logical connection to provide confidence in the identity of the entities connected

+ Data origin authentication

In a connectionless transfer, provides assurance that the source of received data is as claimed

#### `Access control`

The ability to limit and control the access to host systems and applications via communications links

To achieve this, each entity trying to gain access must first be identified, or authenticated, so that access rights can be tailored to the individual

#### `Data confidentiality`

The protection of transmitted data from passive attacks 
*  Broadest service protects all user data transmitted between two users over a period of time
+ Narrower forms of service include the protection of a single message or even specific fields within a message

The Protection of traffic flow from analysis
+ This requires that an attacker not be able to observe the source and destination, frequency, length, or other characteristics of the traffic on a communications facility

#### `Data integrity`

+ Connection Integrity with Recovery

Provides for the integrity of all user data on a connection and detects any modification, insertion, deletion, or replay of any data within an entire data sequence, with recovery attempted

+ Connection Integrity withou Recovery

As above, but provides only detection without recovery

+ Selective-Field Connection Integrity

Provides for the integrity of selected fields within the user data of a data block transferred over a connection and takes the form of determination of whether the selected fields have been modified, inserted, deleted, or replayed

+ Connectionless Integrity

Provides for the integrity of a single connectionless data block an may take the form of detection of data modification. Additionally, a limited form of replay detection may be provided

+ Selective-Field Connectionless Integrity

Provides for the integrity of selected fields within a single connectionless data block; takes the form of determination of whether the selected fields have been modified


#### `Nonrepudiation`

Prevents either sender or receiver from denying a transmitted message

When a message is sent, the receiver can prove that the alleged sender in fact sent the message

When a message is received, the sender can prove that the alleged receiver in fact received the message

### RFC4949

A processing or communication service provided by a system to give a specific kind of protection to system resources
