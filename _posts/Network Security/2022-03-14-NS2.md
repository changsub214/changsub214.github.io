## Symmetric Encryption and Message Confidentiality

<img src="/assets/image/ns-image/ns-001.png" width="825" height="350"> 

There are two requirements for secure use of symmetric encryption
+ A strong encryption algorithm
+ Sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key secure

The security of symmetric encryption depends on the secrecy of the key, not the secrecy of the algorithm
+ This makes it feasible for widespread use
+ Manufacturers can and have developed low-cost chip implementations of data encryption algorithms
+ These chips are widely available and incorporated into a number of products

### Cryptography

Attempt to find the plaintext or key

> Cryptographic systems are generically classified along three independent dimensions

+ The type of operations used for transforming plaintext to ciphertext
    - `Substitution`
        + Each element in the plaintext is mapped into another element
    - `Transposition`
        + Elements in the plaintext are rearranged
        + Fundamental requirement is that no information be lost
    - `Product systems`
        + Involve multiple stages of substitutions and transpositions

+ The number of keys used
    - Referred to as `symmetric`, `single-key`, `secret-key`, or `conventional encryption` if both sender and receiver use the same key
    - Referred to as `asymmetric`, `two-key`, or `public-key encryption` if the sender and receiver each use a different key

+ The way in which the plaintext is processed
    - Block cipher processes the input one block of elements at a time, producing an output block for each input block
    - Stream cipher processes the input elements continuously, producing output one element at a time, as it goes along

### Types of Attacks on Encrypted Messages

### Feistal

### Brute force attack

+ Involves trying every possible key until an intelligible translation of the ciphertext into plaintext is obtained
+ On average, half of all possible keys must be tried to achieve success
+ Unless known plaintext is provided, the analyst must be able to recognize plaintext as plaintext
+ To supplement the brute-force approach
    - Some degree of knowledge about the expected plaintext is needed
    - Some means of automatically distinguishing plaintext from garble is also needed

### Symmetric block encryption algorithms

+ `Block cipher`
    - The most commonly used symmetric encryption alogrithms
    - Processes the plaintext input in fixed-sized blocks and produces a block of ciphertext of equal size for each plaintext block

#### The three most important symmetric block ciphers

+ `DES`
    - Data Encryption standard
    - Most widely used encryption scheme
    - Issued in 1977 as Federal Information Processing Standard 46(`FIPS 46`) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology(`NIST`)
    - The algorithm itself is referred to as the Data Encryption Algorithm(`DEA`)
    - Description of the algorithm
        + Plaintext is 64 bits in length
        + Key is 56 bits in length
        + Structure is a minor variation of the `Feistel network`
        + There are 16 rounds of processing
        + 16 48-bit subkeys are generated from the original key and used in each round (16개의 48bit 서브키)
        + Processof decryption is essentially the same as the encryption process
    + It's not in use now
+ `Triple DES`
    + 3-DES guidelines
        + 3DES is the FIPS-approved symmetric encryption algorithm of choice
        + The original DES, which uses a single 56-bit key, is permitted under the standard for legacy systems only; new procurements should support 3DES
        + Government organizations with legacy DES systems are encouraged to transition to 3DES
        + It is anticipated that 3DES and the Advanced Encryption Standard(`AES`) will coexist as FIPS-approved algorithms, allowing for a gradual transition to `AES`

+ `AES`
    - In 1997 `NIST` issued a call for proposals for a new `AES`
        + Should have a security strength equal to or better than `3DES` and significantly improved efficiency
        + Must be a symmetric block cipher with a block length of `128` bits and support for key lengths of `128`, `192`, and `256` bits
        + Evaluation item
            - 보안
            - 계산적 효율성
            - 메모리 요구량
            - 하드웨어와 소프트웨어적 적합성
            - 유연성
        + `NIST` selected `Rijndael` as the proposed `AES` algorithm 
        + `AES` is not `Feistal` structure
        + Parallelize the entire data block using `substitution` and `transposition` in each round
        + Four operations
            - Substitute bytes
            - Shift rows
            - Mix columns
            - Add round key
